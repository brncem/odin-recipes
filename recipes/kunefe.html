    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>

Kunefe is a Middle Eastern dessert made with shredded phyllo dough layers, sweet cheese filling, and fragrant syrup. To make it, coat shredded phyllo dough in butter, create a base layer in a baking dish, add a layer of sweet cheese, top with more dough, and bake until golden and crispy. Pour syrup over it when it's hot, garnish with nuts, and serve warm for a delightful dessert.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the Syrup:</b>

            In a saucepan, combine 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water.
            Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes until it thickens slightly.
            Add 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice and, if desired, a few drops of rose or orange blossom water for a delightful aroma.
            Once the syrup reaches a desirable consistency, remove it from the heat and let it cool. Set it aside for later use.</li>
            <li><b>Prepare the Kadayif Layers:</b>

                Start by finely shredding the kadayif (shredded phyllo dough) in a bowl.
                Drizzle melted unsalted butter over the kadayif and mix thoroughly until it's evenly coated.</li>
                <li><b>Layering in the Baking Dish:</b>

                    Take half of the buttered kadayif and press it firmly into the bottom of a well-greased baking dish, forming the base layer.
                    Spread a layer of sweet, mild cheese (mozzarella or akkawi) evenly over the kadayif base.
                    Cover the cheese layer with the remaining buttered kadayif to create the upper layer.</li>
                    <li><b>Baking:</b>  

                        Preheat your oven to around 350°F (175°C).
                        Bake the kunefe in the preheated oven for approximately 30-40 minutes, or until it turns a beautiful golden brown and becomes crispy.</li>
                        <li><b>Soaking:</b>

                            As soon as you take the kunefe out of the oven, pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot pastry. Allow it to soak in and sweeten the layers.</li>
                            <li><b>Garnish:</b>

                                Finish by sprinkling crushed pistachios or finely chopped nuts on top of the kunefe for added flavor and texture.</li>
                                <li><b>Serving:</b>

                                    Serve the kunefe warm to enjoy the contrasting textures of crispy and gooey, along with the delightful sweetness of the syrup.</li>
